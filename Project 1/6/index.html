  Drove for hours just to see your face
  We should've talked if just to clear the space
  But now we stare at each other
  Buryin' whatever feeling that was
  He texts to keep your heart D-stacks
  Keep your heart
  These girls are smart D-stacks
  These girls are smart
  I don't know
  Why get a dog, it's just gonna die
  Everything you love's just gonna leave you one day
  And that's just real shit he can still spit
  But what's the point
  I said a lot of stupid stuff
  I think that I was growin' up

  What kind of love don't hurt so bad
  What kind of love don't feel this way
  What kind of love would make me fold

  Little lies [6x]

  Na na na na na na na na

  Little lie
