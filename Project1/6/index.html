  Drove for hours just to see your face
  We should've talked if just to clear the space
  But now we stare at each other
  Buryin' whatever feeling that was
  He texts to keep your heart D-stacks
  <a href="../7/index.html">Keep your heart</a>
  These girls are smart D-stacks
  These girls are smart
